### About
Machine Learning for Finance explores new advances in machine learning and shows how they can be applied across the financial sector, including insurance, transactions, and lending. This course explains the concepts and algorithms behind the main machine learning techniques and provides example Python code for implementing the models yourself.

The course systematically explains how machine learning works on structured data, text, images, and time series. You'll cover generative adversarial learning, reinforcement learning, debugging, and launching machine learning products. Later labs will discuss how to fight bias in machine learning. The course ends with an exploration of Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming.
